1. Soak the dried seaweed in cold water for 5 to 10 minutes while allowing it to expand. Drain the water away and rinse the seaweed a couple of times in running water. Drain/squeeze the water out. (If you’re using non pre-cut dried seaweed, cut it with scissors – about little finger lengths). Set it aside.

2. Combine the sliced beef with the salt and black pepper in a small bowl. Mix them well and set aside until needed.

3. Pre heat a medium pot over medium heat (about 20 seconds). Add the sesame oil, seaweed and beef. Stir them well until the beef is partly cooked (about 2 mins). Add the soy sauce, garlic and water. Cover the pot and boil over medium – medium high heat until the meat is fully cooked (10 to 15 mins). Adjust the taste with more salt if needed.

4. Serve warm with a bowl of steamed rice and other Korean side dishes.
